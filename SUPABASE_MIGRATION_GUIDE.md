# 🎯 SUPABASE MIGRATION - STEP BY STEP GUIDE

## ⚡ Quick Action Items

### 1. Run the Migration in Supabase (2 minutes)
```sql
-- Copy and paste the entire contents of SUPABASE_EMAIL_MIGRATION.sql
-- into your Supabase SQL Editor and click "RUN"
```

### 2. Update Environment Variables (30 seconds)
```bash
# Add these to your Supabase environment or .env file:
EMAIL_SERVICE=gmail
EMAIL_FROM=Anyhow Fitness <noreply@yourdomain.com>
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com

```

## 🔍 What the Migration Does

### Database Changes
✅ **Adds email column** with unique constraint and validation  
✅ **Adds email verification system** (ready for future use)  
✅ **Adds display_name column** for clearer user identification  
✅ **Converts existing users** to temporary email format  
✅ **Sets up indexes** for performance  
✅ **Updates custom_exercises** for primary/secondary muscles  

### Email Format for Existing Users
- Users with phone: `user_1234567890@temp.anyhowfitness.com`
- Users without phone: `john_doe@temp.anyhowfitness.com`
- All marked as `email_verified: true` (they were already using the app)

## 🚨 IMPORTANT NOTES

### Before Migration
- ✅ **Backup your database** (Supabase > Settings > Database > Create backup)
- ✅ **Test in development first** if you have a staging environment
- ✅ **Inform users** that they'll need to update their email addresses

### After Migration  
- 🔧 **Users with temp emails** will need to update to real emails
- 🔧 **Frontend forms** need updating to use email inputs
- 🔧 **Welcome emails** will be sent to new registrations
- 🔧 **Forgot password** will work via email OTP

## 📱 Frontend Updates Needed

### Update Registration Form
```javascript
// Change from:
<input name="phoneNumber" type="tel" />

// To:
<input name="email" type="email" />
```

### Add Forgot Password Form
```javascript
// New forgot password flow:
const [email, setEmail] = useState('');
const [otp, setOtp] = useState('');
const [newPin, setNewPin] = useState('');

// 1. Request OTP: auth.requestResetCode(email)
// 2. Verify & Reset: auth.resetPin(email, otp, newPin)
```
